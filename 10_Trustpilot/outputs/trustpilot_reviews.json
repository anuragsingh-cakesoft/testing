I accidentally added a member to my annual subscription and contacted support, but they refused a refund because I didn’t reach out within 3 days.What’s frustrating is their policy allows 30 days to request refunds for annual subscriptions, yet this doesn’t apply to accidental member additions. This inconsistency is unfair, especially for an honest mistake. I find their approach rigid and lacking understanding toward users. Greater flexibility could have avoided this poor experience.Additionally, they could have been more transparent at the time of renewal about the cost of using their AI features, which were free during the first year.Due to these issues, I will not be renewing my subscription after my current annual period ends.",

You can be charged for additional subscriptions that were merely intended for page sharing.

Looks like someone has been buying fake reviews.AVOID AVOID AVOIDAlso, worryingly - I just noticed after finally being able to cancel (a FREE PLAN mind) Monzo informs me that they have conducted an 'Active Card Check' ??I had nothing owed so this is highly suspicious.If these guys have your details, I'd remove them ASAP.---Professional companies usually respond... Why am I not surprised?",

The BIGGEST red flag to this platform is there is NO OPTION TO REMOVE CREDIT CARD INFO forever. THere is 0 choice to remove your financial details, and if you forget, i guess you'll fund them indefinitely.

This does not seem to be a serious company based on my experiences, so beware if you are pushing this on others. They are charging for things I have canceled, they are ping-ponging you about everywhere when you try to contact them, they don't honor their refund policy, they used false evidence/evidence from another account than mine when arguing their case, and at last, they just ghosted me. Unresolved, complete and utter silence. Thankfully I have already fallen in love with Coda.io, which is the same type of product, only much better and in a format that can actually be used by real organizations. I just wanted to see if Notion was anything like that, but it is not.",

Never had issues until now, although I have to say some clients have found it a little temperamental.My Notion has completely frozen, cannot access it at all. For the past 3 weeks I’ve been trying to get a response. They have now raised a support ticket & have escalated it (although just feel like they are passing the book as no real response yet).Just received an email this morning stating that they haven’t heard from me for 2 days so if I don’t respond they will close the case. The last correspondence from them clearly states my case has been escalated & THEY will be in touch, they even apologise for the wait! I’m not hopeful at all. Something isn’t right. It appears they are too busy launching new features.I can’t even access my account to cancel my subscription which is due to be paid in July!I’m fortunate I don’t have anything of great importance on there, like some other users.Basically Notion is a great tool when it works… when it doesn’t you are left high & dry with zero customer support leaving you no other option but to cancel.",

      "reviewBody": "Notion may have several unique features, but customer support is absolutely horrible. I have been waiting for over 103 days for response to why there was failure in importing a small CSV file into an existing Notion database. This should be a quick response from a company that prides itself on its database solutions. CSV files and databases are so old-school that this isn't even a beginner issue. Yet in the import there is no field mapping and the Notion documentation on merge/import amounts to one sentence. And more importantly with all the \"apology\" and \"understanding\" from the uncountable number of support personnel, my support ticket has been dropped over and over and over again. Plus they are now refusing to connect me with a responsible person so I may file a complaint.So Notion: come for the fun stuff and when the going gets tough, do not count on any support.",
